# MiniProject-WQU-OLS_DisneySP500
In this assignment, we want to evaluate how Disney performed as an invest- ment between October 2008 and September 2013 and how risky it is. To do that we need to regresse monthly raw returns on Disney against returns on the S&amp;P 500 over that period. Analyze parameters of the resulting regression model.
